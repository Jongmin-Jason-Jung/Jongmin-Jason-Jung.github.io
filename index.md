Fields of interest : Health Economics and Applied Microeconomics

My work integrates applied microeconomics and health economics to investigate how policy and program design influence physical activity and health outcomes in older adults.

I leverage microeconometric methods to identify the determinants of fitness program uptake, with a current focus on the causal effects of Medicare Advantage fitness benefits on seniorsâ€™ health behaviors.
