- **Get Fit with MA? Estimating the Impact of Medicare Advantage on Physical Activity** - Abstract
  
  <small>
  Medicare Advantage (MA) plans increasingly offer fitness benefits yet evidence on their causal impact remains limited. Using fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we provide the first quasi-experimental evidence about the impact of MA enrollment on seniors' physical activity. Linking nationally representative survey data on workout behavior with insurance records, we find that MA enrollment significantly increases vigorous workout days while no comparable effect is observed for Traditional Medicare (TM) which does not offer fitness benefits. Three robustness checks including placebo test, doughnut-hole analysis, and inverse probability weighting regression adjustments support the validity of our findings. The results highlight the role of structured insurance design in shaping health behaviors and indicate that fitness benefits in MA encourage more active lifestyles, offering timely and actionable insights for policymakers to promote healthy aging through targeted benefit structures.
